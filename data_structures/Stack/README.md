# Stack

A stack is a basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile, a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.

The basic implementation of a stack is also called a LIFO (Last In First Out) to demonstrate the way it accesses data.
